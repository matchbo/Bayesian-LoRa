# Bayesian-LoRa
Implements bayesian inference for a transformer neural network by implementing bayesian capabilities only for a low rank adaptation of the network (by adding low-rank matrices into the network which are bayesian. This system also uses vbll to implement a bayesian NN last layer, and stochastic weighted-averaging gaussian (SWAG) as the optimiser
